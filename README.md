Shannon's Binary encoding Algorithm using C++

There are 5 encoding steps, as follows                                                                                 
Step 1: List the source symbols in the order of decreasing probabilities.                                                                   
Step 2: Compute the alpha sequences.                                                                                    
Step 3: Determine the smallest integer value of li using the inequality.                                                                   
Step 4: Expand the decimal number alpha in the binary form up to li places neglecting expansion beyond li places.                                                    
Step 5: Remove the binary point to get the desired code.
